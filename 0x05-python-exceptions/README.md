### Tasks

**0. Safe list printing**
+ Write a function that prints x elements of a list.

Prototype: def safe_print_list(my_list=[], x=0):
my_list can contain any type (integer, string, etc.)
All elements must be printed on the same line followed by a new line.
x represents the number of elements to print
x can be bigger than the length of my_list
Returns the real number of elements printed
You have to use try: / except:
You are not allowed to import any module
